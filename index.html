  <h3>Alpha Engineering <span class="sub-acc-headers">Branding and website design</span></h3>
  <div>
    <p>Alpha Engineering Solutions has been at the forefront of the manufacturing of precision-machined parts and assemblies for over 18 years. I designed a concept for their re-brand and corporate website. I created a strong but very simple logo design along with a minimalist website design.</p>

  <h3>Fillscreen <span class="sub-acc-headers">Development -jquery</span></h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      Simple page that displays a white rectangle centred on a black background. When the user taps the white square, it animates the white rectangle so that it fills the screen, and then  animates to its original dimensions. This entire sequence takes 3 seconds to complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      The orientation and positioning of the square is consistent between portrait and landscape orientations. (Meaning that the left + right sides is higher in portrait mode and the top + bottom sides longer in landscape).
    </p>
    <p>
      The rectangle's initial dimensions is 20% of the devices width and height respectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      The page is optimised for webkit mobile devices (android and iOS).
    </p>
      The final product is executable purely within the browser without relying on a backend.

  <h3>Photobox <span class="sub-acc-headers">development - jQuery</span></h3>
  <div>
    <p>From a given "users" JSON object I wrote the code needed to display it on a website folloing this format:</p>
    <p>- A User ID Tag is a 300x300px square filled with the tag background color.</p>
    <p>- Display a User ID Tag for each user.</p> 
    <p>- The users should be sorted by their IDs.</p>
    <p>- The tag background colors should be randomly picked - different for each user and different with every refresh. </p>
    <p>- On mouse-over each tag should change to have white background and display user name, mention name and email in black.</p>
    <p>- The tags should be displayed in a never ending grid - 3 tags per row, as many rows as needed to display all users.</p> 
    <p>- Number of tags per row is reduced with the screen size so on narrow screens we will just see one column of user tags.</p>
